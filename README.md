## About

This was my second project built using React JS + TypeScript and the objective was to study and familiarizing myself with this framework.

I wanted to to build an application using some weather API because it's free and there are plenty of options, so I choosed the Open Weather API. Originally, I wanted to create an application where users could input the name of some city and get the result of the weather data about that city. However, I know that there are millions of projects like this because almost every web development learner built one of this type of project üòÅ.

I started thinking about what I could do to make the app different from the other ones and then I remembered my mom. She is always very careful with me and when I go to some place she always ask me if I got everything, like my coat when it is cold or suncream when it is hot and sunny. Also, I was thinking about the name of the profession that tell the people about the weather and I found a version as "weatherman". After that it was easy and then I built "Weathermom", a virtual mom that tells you about what you need to take to the place you are going to, based in the weather in that place.

I created two API keys, one for the Open Weather API and the other one for the Google Places API.

In this project I used different packages:

* **react-i18next** for internationalization, so the mom can write in more than one language;
* **react-icons** for the icons in the project;
* **react-loading-icons** for the loading icons in the project;
* **react-type-animation** for the typing effect in the chat between the user and the mom;
* **react-google-autocomplete** for bringing the cities based on the string typed in the input element.

I could learn a lot about the React infrastructure as how to create my own hooks and that it is not allowed to call hooks inside other hooks, only from components.

I chosed to use Vite to minimize initial setup and invest more time in working in the project business logic.
